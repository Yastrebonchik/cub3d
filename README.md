Current project inspired with the one of the first FPS game (DOOM) and stands for creating a simple game engine using raycasting principle. User can create a map with corresponding setting via configfile and explore the map with player on it. To test use an executable "cub3d" (Makefile is also presented and default rule builds the project) with config file as it's argument. Using option "--save" as second argument saves a screenshot of first picture the player sees after start of program. Works only on MacOs.
